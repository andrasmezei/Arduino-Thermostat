First and most importantly, you should not attempt to modify your existing thermostat or build one as shown here unless you are qualified to do so.  There is a real risk of electrocution, fire or damage to your Heat/AC unit, even if you follow these guidelines perfectly.

This repo is basically a straight dump of my codebase.  I wrote this between 10/2010 and 1/2011 and have been using the LCD_Thermostat_V3 code for my thermostat at my house for several months.

Here's a breakdown of the folders:

* LCD_Thermostat_V1
  My first try at the thermostat codebase.  At this point I had the LCD working, 
  a photoresister for auto-dimming and the thermistors for temperature input.
  
* LCD_Thermostat_V2
  For V2, I prototyped all the temperature averaging and adjusting code as well
  as the relay control code.  This is very messy and I never used it in production.

* LCD_Thermostat_V3
  This is the version I am using.  It is fully functional and has been running since
  January 2011.  I noticed that it did freeze and the heat was stuck on once in 6
  months.  I attibuted this to a very poor source of regulated power.
  
* thermistor
  A thermistor diagnostics sketch
  
* Thermostat_RelayBoard
  The code that I used to diagnose / stress test my relay board that is used to switch 
  the Heat, AC and Fan power.
